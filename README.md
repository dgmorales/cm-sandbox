# vagrant-cfgmgmt-sandbox
Vagrant environment showcasing Puppet, Ansible, Salt with examples and associated tools.

For now we have only some machines with puppet, ansible and salt installed  and a couple examples of code in each.

TODO:

- Install Puppet Server, with PuppetDB and Puppet Explorer
  - Add Puppetboard?
- Install Salt master
  - Add Saltpad
- Install an Ansible Control Machine
  - Add rundeck
  - Add Semaphore
- Add a complex multi-machine example making the same thing on each CM
- Turn that complex example into a multi distro one (CentOS + Ubuntu)

Someday maybe:
- Add Chef to the mix
